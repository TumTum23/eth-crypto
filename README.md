# eth-crypto

A Rust crate for simple ethereum-style cryptography.  This software is intended
for educational purposes and is made availabe with absolutely no warranty of
any kind.

Tests in this codebase currently only validate the basic functioning of
the API abstractions, and do not necessarily ensure the correctness of
the underlying cryptography.  This library is primarily reliant on the
`tiny-keccak` and `secp256k1` libraries for underlying cryptographic
functionality.
